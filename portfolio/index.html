                                 Educator turned (aspiring) web developer! Born and raised in North Carolina, my passion to somehow positively change the face of education to include more project-based learning and meaningful experiences started to form during my senior year in high school. For the past eight years, I have spent most of my time teaching  students grades K-5 the fundamentals of learning. For the past two years, I have been a STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art and math) teacher in Cary, NC.

                                I integrate coding, mostly visual programming, in most lessons. Recently, I decided to not only deepen my own understanding, but to bring more programming and web developing into my classroom.  With the skills learned in the UNC Coding Bootcamp, I aspire to create web applications and sites to benefit students, teachers and educators at all levels.
